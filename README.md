Rice Leaf Disease Detection
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting major rice leaf diseases using image classification techniques. The system helps farmers and researchers quickly identify diseases from rice leaf images, enabling early treatment and improved crop yield.

🎯 Objectives

Perform data analysis on rice leaf images

Build a deep learning model to classify diseases

Detect 3 major rice plant diseases:

Leaf Smut

Brown Spot

Bacterial Leaf Blight

Apply data augmentation and compare model performances

🛠️ Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries: TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

Model: CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)

Dataset: 120 rice leaf images (40 per disease category)

⚙️ Workflow

Data Preprocessing & Augmentation

Model Training (CNN & comparison with other ML models)

Model Evaluation & Performance Report
